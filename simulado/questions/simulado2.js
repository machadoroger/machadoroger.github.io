Participants: Scrum Masters/Team Coaches, other select Team members and SMEs if necessary; 4. Weekly or more frequently (30~60 minutes); 5. Timeboxed and followed by a meet-after. These are the Sync Events that help the ART stay on track: 1. Coach Sync: Focus on executing the current PI, including risk, dependencies, progress and impediments; 2. PO Sync: Manages the PI's scope, reviews progress, adjusts priorities and prepares for the following PI; 3. ART Sync: It's a combination of Coach Sync and PO Sync in a single Event. Extra Tip: The ART Sync usually replaces the Coach Sync and PO Sync for a particular Iteration to reduce overhead. Extra Tip 2: The Coach Sync Event was called Scrum of Scrums. The name of this Event was updated in the new version of the SAFe Framework. (SAFe 6.0)"

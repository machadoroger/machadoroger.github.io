    "explanation": "Conflicts may occur in every Team. However, common objectives around commitments ensure those conflicts be managed constructively among Team members. One way to manage and remove the fear of conflict among the Team members is aligning them to shared commitments. Extra Tip: Giving every Team member the opportunity to contribute is a good facilitation technique to encourage everyone's participation, but it doesn't work when the objectives/commitments aren't shared, because in that case, everyone will want to prioritize their own individual commitments and even if they contribute in a \"forced\" way, they'll still be afraid of causing conflicts."

If dependency can't be removed, in this case foster cross-team collaboration to minimize possible risk on value delivery. 2. It aligns the ART to established DevOps practices: Establish DevOps practices is one of the ultimate goal for ARTs to improve execution via Continuous Delivery Pipeline.
